# CalculatorUsingAndroid
This is my first android application where I have built an arithmatical calculator.

##Some of the features pertaining to android : 
1. Makes use of android development components like the **LinearLayout, TextView and Buttons**.
2. The app is **responsive** ( works in portrait as well as landscape mode) .
3. The app is designed to work even if the *device is rotated*. 
By default, when the screen is rotated the activity is killed and restarted. 
To make sure no data is lost, I've saved and restored the data using the lifecycle methods like **"onSaveInstanceState" and "onRestoreInstanceState"**
